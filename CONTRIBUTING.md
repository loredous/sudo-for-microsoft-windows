## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

- Join the [#Build_Monitoring_Tools](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C05D6TWKZ1P) Slack channel
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide details about the specific job, environment, and issues you are seeing

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of the tool.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- Collect information about the bug:
    - Windows version, Command being run, etc
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If so, can you provide an example showing the issue?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> Sensitive bugs or issues with security implications must be sent by email to <it-security-product-engineering@vmware.com>
> If you believe that there may be wider security implications, please also include <soc@vmware.com>

We use a private Jira project to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Reach out to us directly via the [#Build_Monitoring_Tools](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C05D6TWKZ1P) Slack channel, or at <it-security-product-engineering@vmware.com>
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, the issue will be added to our Jira backlog. If you wish to fix the bug yourself, feel free to let us know and [check out details on how.](#your-first-code-contribution).


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Sudo for Windows. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we will prioritize features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider contributing all or part of a feature yourself.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked in our internal Jira instance

- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to other Sudo for Windows users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
